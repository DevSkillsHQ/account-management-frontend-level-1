# Transaction Management Frontend - Level 1

Your task is to **build a frontend app** that **integrates with the Transaction Management API** and **make the provided E2E tests pass**.

Please agree with your hiring team regarding the tech stack choice.

Here's how your app could look:

Feel free to tweak the UI, but please ensure that the following HTML is in place.

#### The form for submitting transactions

```html
<form data-type="transaction-form">
  <input data-type="account-id" ... />
  <input data-type="amount" ... />
</form>
```

Both input **fields should be cleared** after the form is submitted.

#### The transaction list

Every new transaction goes on **the top of the list** and should have an enclosing `<div />` with the following structure:

```html
<div 
     data-type="transaction"
     data-account-id="${transaction-account-id}"
     data-amount="${transaction-amount}"
     data-balance="${current-account-balance}" ...>
  ...
</div>
```

- `${transaction-account-id}` - account id of the corresponding transaction.
- `${transaction-amount}` - transaction amount.
- `${current-account-balance}` - the current balance of the corresponding account right after submitting the transaction.

## Before you get started

#### Import boilerplate

Use [this link](https://docs.devskills.co/collections/85-the-interview-process/articles/342-importing-challenge-boilerplate) to get boilerplate code for your tech stack to configure a minimal setup for running the E2E tests.

<details>
<summary>Alternatevily, use the manual setup.</summary>

1. Update the `baseUrl` (where your app will run) in [cypress.json](cypress.json).
2. Update the [`build`](package.json#L5) and [`start`](package.json#L6) scripts in [package.json](package.json) to respectively build and start your app.
